# Twitter Retweet Bot using Python & Tweepy
A relatively simple Python-built Twitter retweet bot using Tweepy. Searches and retweets based on hashtag or keyword value.

What You Need
----------

* [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) - An easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API.

`pip install tweepy`

Instructions
----------

* Out of general OS hygiene, create a new directory to contain all of your retweet bot files.

`mkdir retweet-bot`

* Create a new [Twitter Application](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new). This is where you'll generate your keys, tokens, and secrets.
* Fill in your keys, tokens, and secrets in the keys.py file.
* Check comments in retweet.py to tweak the retweet bot to your liking.
* Run your retweet.py

`python retweet.py`

* Note: Make sure that your retweet.py and keys.py files are, obviously, in the same directory.
